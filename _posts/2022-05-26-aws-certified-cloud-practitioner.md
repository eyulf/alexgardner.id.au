On {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}, I passed the [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C01)][aws-clf-exam] exam, and am now an [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner][aws-clf-cert].

This is now my 7th AWS certification, it is also the foundational certification and is the least difficult in terms of study materials and the exam. As such I did not actually study for this exam, or complete any practice exams. Instead I relied on my current knowledge and experience of AWS to pass the exam within 20 minutes.
