For my historical forge, I wanted to ensure that it would be very resilient, portable and use historical construction techniques as much as possible. I also massively over-engineered it, the firebox itself ended up weighing more than one of my smaller anvils. I started out with a rough idea of how I wanted to build it (after making and reworking several plans). I also started this with almost no experience in woodworking.

Firstly I purchased a couple of 2.4m lengths of seasoned 190x45mm hardwood.

Then I made liberal use of a big overhead router and table saw at a local maker space (aptly called [MakerSpace][makerspace]). My plan at this stage was to use sliding dovetails to fit the ends to the sides, however, the receiving side ended up snapping on the first test fit so I promptly scrapped that idea.

I then opted to use a regular dovetail join, on a scale large enough for the wood I was using. Following my first attempt at dovetailing, I got some practice in with my partner's parents while we were staying over for Christmas.

It took some time to make the dovetailing joins on the larger pieces, however, I got there in the end. A side effect of changing the join mid-project is that the ends do show the channel that I made for sliding the base in.

It took some effort and a false start, but the outcome is a solid firebox, that will easily take abuse.

I have not weighed it, however, I estimate that it is at least 20 KGs. It's easily big enough to contain a decent sized fire without the danger of burning the firebox itself. I plan to document further progress in building my historical forge.
