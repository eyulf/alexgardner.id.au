For my historical forge, I wanted to ensure that it would be very resilient, portable and use historical construction techniques as much as possible. I also massively over engineered it, the firebox itself ended up weighing more then one of my smaller anvils. I started out with a rough idea of how I wanted to build it (after making and reworking several plans). I also started this with almost no experience in woodworking.

<div class="box alt">
    <div class="row uniform 50%">
        <div class="12u centre">
            <span class="image 12u">
                <img class="post-img centre" src="/assets/images/blog/forge-plan.jpg" title="Draft Plans" alt="Draft Plans">
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

Firstly I purchased a couple of 2.4m lengths of seasoned 190x45mm hardwood.

<div class="box alt">
    <div class="row uniform 50%">
        <div class="12u centre">
            <span class="image 12u">
                <img class="post-img centre" src="/assets/images/blog/forge-firebox1.jpg" title="The Hardwood" alt="The Hardwood">
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

Then I made liberal use of a big overhead router and table saw at a local maker space (aptly called [MakerSpace][makerspace]). My plan at this stage was to use sliding dovetails to fit the ends to the sides, however the receiving side ended up snapping on the first test fit so I promptly scrapped that idea.

<div class="box alt">
    <div class="row uniform 50%">
        <div class="12u centre">
            <span class="image 12u">
                <img class="post-img centre" src="/assets/images/blog/forge-firebox2.jpg" title="Early Dry Fitting" alt="Early Dry Fitting">
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

I then opted to use a regular dovetail join, on a scale large enough for the wood I was using. Following my first attempt at dovetailing, I got some practice in with my partner's parents while we were staying over for Christmas.

<div class="box alt">
    <div class="row uniform 50%">
        <div class="12u centre">
            <span class="image 12u">
                <img class="post-img centre" src="/assets/images/blog/forge-firebox3.jpg" title="Dovetail Practise" alt="Dovetail Practise">
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

It took some time to make the dovetailing joins on the larger pieces, however I got there in the end. A side effect of changing the join mid project is that the ends do show the channel that I made for sliding the base in.

<div class="box alt">
    <div class="row uniform 50%">
        <div class="12u centre">
            <span class="image 12u">
                <img class="post-img centre" src="/assets/images/blog/forge-firebox4.jpg" title="Inserting the Base" alt="Inserting the Base">
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

t took some effort and a false start, but the outcome is a solid firebox, that will easily take abuse. 

<div class="box alt">
    <div class="row uniform 50%">
        <div class="12u centre">
            <span class="image 12u">
                <img class="post-img centre" src="/assets/images/blog/forge-firebox5.jpg" title="The finished Firebox" alt="The finished Firebox">
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

I have not weighed it, however I estimate that it is at least 20 KGs. It's easily big enough to contain a decent sized fire without danger of burning the firebox itself. I plan to document further progress in building my historical forge.
