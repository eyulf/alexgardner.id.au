On {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}, I passed the [AWS Certified Developer - Associate (DVA-C01)][aws-dva-exam] exam, and am now an [AWS Certified Developer - Associate][aws-dva-cert].

I did not originally plan on earning this associate certificate after the related professional certificate, however, challenges and incentives by work changed my order of approach in certificates. I did not study as much specifically for this exam as I have for previous exams, as there was a lot of overlap with the [DevOps Engineer - Professional certification][aws-dop] that I recently achieved. Instead my approach was to use practice exams to identify any weaknesses and used that to drive some focused study sessions. The study material I did end up using was re-watching parts of the [Developer - Associate][cantrill-dva-course] by [Adrian Cantrill][cantrill]. The specific study resources used were:

* Practical experience through working professionally with AWS
* Adrian Cantrill's [Developer - Associate training course][cantrill-dva-course]
* [Practice Exams][tutorialsdojo-dva] by Tutorials Dojo
* [Study Guide eBook][tutorialsdojo-dva-guide] by Tutorials Dojo

In terms of the exam itself, I did not get any questions that were not covered by the study material and, with the exception of a small handful, did not find them too difficult.
