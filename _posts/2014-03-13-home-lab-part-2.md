It's been a while since I've done an update on my HomeLab, and there have been changes. I've started migrating my OpenVZ containers over to CentOS, as this is something I need more experience in. I've also stopped using the Whitebox due to hardware issues, and have instead turned the microserver into the main VM host. This is the current setup.

        </div>

The labels in the above picture are wrong as I've overhauled my internal domain. A recent addition is the UPS I purchased shortly after the last homelab post. Currently my lab is using ~90 watts power (~2.16 kWh/day). I've also made up a quick network map which is below.
