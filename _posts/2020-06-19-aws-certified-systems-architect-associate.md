On {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }} I passed the [AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate][aws-saa-exam] exam, and am now an [AWS Certified Systems Architect - Associate][aws-saa-cert].

This certification marks the true start of my journey into the AWS Cloud and in one way serves as a milestone in my career. Before I started studying for this certification I had not used AWS or other cloud technologies very extensively, my only experience with AWS up until I started studying was hosting this website on S3 and Cloudfront.

The study process itself was fairly straight forward and took several months of on-off study, this was assisted greatly by work running an AWS Certification Drive to help certify more staff in AWS. Study resources included:

* Work provided challenges to build practical AWS experience
* Official AWS documentation and FAQs
* A Cloud Guru's exam specific [AWS training course][acg-saa-course]
* Stephane Maarek's exam specific [AWS training course][udemy-saa-course] on Udemy
* [Practise Exams][whizlabs-saa] by Whizlabs


When first looking at practice exams, I found that the A Cloud Guru course was not enough on it's own and further study was required. I then found the course by Stephane Maarek and discovered there were gaps between the two courses. Doing both of these courses combined with a leisurely study pace and reading up on AWS documentation were able to provide the knowledge that was tested by the exam.

As this was my first AWS exam, I studied as much as I could to help ensure I was able to pass the exam. I found that actually booking the exam to be excellent motivation to help combat study procastination. After the exam, I felt that I probably could have taken the exam sooner and still passed.
