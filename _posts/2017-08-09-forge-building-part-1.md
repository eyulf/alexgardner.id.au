I've recently decided to build a blacksmithing forge, and wanted to make it as historically accurate as possible. This is so that I can use it at re-enactment events, showcasing how blacksmithing would have occured in that time period. Like most things re-enactment, the first port of call to build accuracy is through researching. My selected time period is approximately 1350-1370.

The complete forging setup I'll be building contains 4 major parts. The first part is the forge itself, which contains a firebox used for the fire. The second is the bellows, which provides a constant stream of air to the firebox. The third is the Anvil used for performing the forging itself. And lastly a grind stone to further refine any blade edges or shapes as needed.

This post is simply detailing the sources I've used to inspire the design I'll be using. Other design considerations include ensuring the completed forge is resilient, as I have no desire to constantly repair this. A further consideration is portability, as I'll be transporting this to and from events.

Many of the sources are from manuscripts, I've made liberal use of the [larsdatter website][larsdatter] for locating links to various sources. This list is not extensive, and may be updated from time to time as I discover new sources.

## Forge/Firebox

Most sources which depict blacksmithing only show permanent stone forges. The only sources for a portable forge I have found, show a large wooden table with large divider on one side. I've elected to be a bit more practical with my firebox, however I will try and incorporate these elements into the frame for the firebox.

## Bellows

The double lung bellows most people associate with blacksmithing does not appear in any sources for this period. I'll be using dual bellows, connected up with a swinging arm, which can raise them one at a time.

## Anvil

Many of the sources for the anvil are the same as the sources for the bellows, as the two usually go hand in hand when depicting blacksmithing. I will be opting to use a small stump anvil, and stump tools, with a larger anvil for heavier work if required.

**Sources**

- [Small 14th to 17th Century Stump Anvil][anvil-3]

## Grindstone

The depicted grindstones are all large, mounted in a wooden frame, and hand operated. Due to the size this would require an assistant. My plan is to use a smaller grindstone which can be used both by hand and foot.
