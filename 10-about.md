<div><span class="image left"><img src="/assets/images/alex-gardner.jpg" alt="" /></span><p>In mid 2014 I made a massive change to my life and moved interstate, away from my friends and family in Adelaide, to Sydney in order to furthur my career. Since then I have stepped up and moved from Technical Support to System Administration.</p>

<p>I have over 7 years of IT experience in general, and have worked in the Hosting and Telecommunication industries. I run a personal <a href="/homelab">homelab</a> which I use to learn new things about technology and practise the art of automating almost everything.</p>

<p>I value freedom and privacy, and support the priciples of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). In my spare time I participate in <a href="/archery">Archery</a> with the <a target="_blank" href="https://medievalarchery.org.au/">Medieval Archery Society</a>.</p>

<!--<p>My preferred method of contact is through <a href="mailto:alex@alexgardner.id.au)">email</a>, my <a href="alex-gardner-public-key.asc">GPG key</a> is avaliable for encrypted communications. I also have a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandergardner?rel=author">LinkedIn</a> page, but do not update it much.</p>-->
