    <p>In mid 2014 I made a massive change to my life and moved interstate, away from my friends and family in Adelaide, to Sydney in order to further my career. Since then I have stepped up and moved from Technical Support to System Administration.</p>

    <p>I have over {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus: site.year_start_it }} years of IT experience in general, and have worked in the Hosting and Telecommunication industries. I run a personal <a href="/homelab">homelab</a> which I use to learn new things about technology and practise the art of automating almost everything.</p>

    <p>I value freedom and privacy, and support the priciples of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). In my spare time I participate in <a href="/reenactment">archery</a> with the <a target="_blank" href="https://medievalarchery.org.au/">Medieval Archery Society</a>, and impose my will onto steel by <a href="/blacksmith">blacksmithing</a>.</p>

    <p>My preferred method of contact is through <a href="mailto:alex@alexgardner.id.au">email</a>, my <a href="/alex-gardner-public-key.asc">GPG key</a> is avaliable for encrypted communications. I also have a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandergardner?rel=author">LinkedIn</a> page, but do not update it much.</p>
