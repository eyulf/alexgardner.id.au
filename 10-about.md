    <p>In mid 2014 I made a massive change to my life and moved interstate, away from my friends and family in Adelaide, to Sydney in order to further my career. Since then I have stepped up and moved from Technical Support to System Administration.</p>

    <p>I have over {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus: site.data.misc.year_started.it }} years of IT experience in general, and have worked in the Hosting and Telecommunication industries. I run a personal <a href="/homelab">homelab</a> which I use to learn new things about technology and practise the art of automating almost everything.</p>

    <p>In my spare time I participate in <a href="/reenactment">archery</a> with the <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.data.links.main.mas }}">Medieval Archery Society</a>, and impose my will onto steel by <a href="/blacksmith">blacksmithing</a>.</p>

    <p>My preferred method of contact is through <a href="mailto:alex@alexgardner.id.au">email</a>. I also have a <a href="{{ site.data.links.main.linkedin }}">LinkedIn</a> page, but update it even less then this website.</p>
