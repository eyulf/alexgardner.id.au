I have a home-lab setup which I use for learning and experimenting with ideas, concepts and technologies. The long term goal of this at the moment is to create an enviroment that is at least semi-autonomous in maintaining itself.

Currently my lab is using ~90 watts power (~2.16 kWh/day). The lab consists of the following hardware:

* HP Proliant N36L Microserver (8GB RAM, 1 TB HDD)
* Qnap TS-410 NAS (4x 2 TB HDD in RAID 5)
* Mikrotik RB2011UAS Router
* Microtik Wireless Router
* TPlink TL-SG3216 switch
* CyberPower UPS PR1500ELCDRTXL2U

I am using the Microserver as my main VM environment. It is being used to run various services including DNS, DHCP, Monitoring, Log collection and Configuration Management.
