<div><p>During my time <a href="/reenactment">re-enacting</a>, I found both the need and the spark for blacksmithing. Eventually over time, this passion grew to the point that I took a couple of professional classes. I am slowly becoming self sufficient, and intend on making the tools I use.</p>

<p>Blacksmithing is a hobby for me, and I do not see myself doing this full time. Part of the enjoyment I find in this comes from the satisfaction of creating things, and seeing them transform from raw material into the desired item. </p>

<p>Currently my primary forge is gas powered, and I own a couple of 20kg Anvils. I am working on establishing a mobile, historically accurate forge complete with tools and accessories.</p>
