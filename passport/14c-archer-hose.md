I wear these with fabric garters, and keep them tied to a belt. They have undergone some repair over the years I've owned them. The seam on the back of the calf is the most common failure point for me, however some of the other seams have now started to loosen. The upper portion on these is currently much too big on me, I can fit my fist in the gap between my thigh and the material.
