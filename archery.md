Medieval Re-enactment and Living History has been one of my interests for many years.

Whilst I have previously been in groups that do Live-Steel re-enactment combat, my current focus is historical archery. I am a member of the [Medieval Archery Society](https://medievalarchery.org.au/), which is based in Western Sydney.

As part of this hobby, I regularly attend various Medieval Festivals held throughout Australia. I also host and manage the websites of groups I am involved in.

I currently portray a English longbowman, during the time of the Hundred Years War. The longbow shown in the picture on the left is a 30 pound self bow made from Ash.

In the near future my skill set will include fletching (making my own arrows), with an eventual goal of learning how to blacksmith and establishing a personal forge.
