<div><span class="image right"><img src="/assets/images/archery.jpg" alt="" /></span><p>Whilst I have previously been in groups that do live-steel re-enactment combat and living history, my current focus is historical archery. I am a member of the <a href="https://medievalarchery.org.au/">Medieval Archery Society</a>, which is based in Western Sydney.</p>

<p>As part of this hobby, I regularly attend various Medieval Festivals held throughout Australia. I also host and manage the websites of groups I am involved in.</p>

<p>I currently portray a English longbowman, during the time of the Hundred Years War. My primary longbow is a 30 pound self bow made from Ash.</p>

<p>In the near future my skill set will include fletching (making my own arrows), with an eventual goal of learning how to blacksmith and establishing a personal forge.</p></div>
