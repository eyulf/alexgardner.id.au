Whilst I have previously been in groups that do live-steel re-enactment combat and living history, my current focus is historical archery and blacksmithing. I am a member of the [Medieval Archery Society]({{ site.data.links.main.mas }}), which is based in South Western Sydney.

I have outlined the kit/garb that I use for re-enactment in more detail on my [re-enactment "passport"]({% link 35-passport.md %}) page. This is essentially "living" documentation for my historical portrayals.

Re-enactment is what introduced me to [blacksmithing]({% link 40-blacksmithing.md %}) and archery. I have also been getting more hands on with different arts and crafts in order to create things I need/use for the hobby. This has ranged from woodworking to sewing, as well as other random skills that have come up along the years.

As part of this hobby, I regularly attend, and camp at, various Medieval Festivals and other events held throughout Australia. I also  host and manage the [Medieval Archery Society]({{ site.data.links.main.mas }}) website, in addition to performing the technical implementation of it's current design.
