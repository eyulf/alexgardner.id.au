    <p>Whilst I have previously been in groups that do live-steel re-enactment combat and living history, my current focus is historical archery. I am a member of the <a href="https://medievalarchery.org.au/">Medieval Archery Society</a>, which is based in South Western Sydney.</p>

    <p>Re-enactment is what has introduced me to <a href="/blacksmith">blacksmithing</a> and archery. I have also been getting more hands on with creating things for the hobby, including fletching (creating arrows), woodworking, and other random bits and pieces that I use for historical camping.</p>

    <p>As part of this hobby, I regularly attend, and camp at, various Medieval Festivals and other events held throughout Australia. I also host and manage the <a href="https://medievalarchery.org.au/">Medieval Archery Society</a> website.</p>

    <p>I currently portray a English longbowman, during the time of the Hundred Years War. My primary longbow is a 30 pound self bow made from Ash.</p>
