Whilst I have previously been in groups that do live-steel re-enactment combat and living history, my current focus is historical archery. I am a member of the [Medieval Archery Society]({{ site.data.links.main.mas }}), which is based in South Western Sydney.

Re-enactment is what has introduced me to [blacksmithing]({% link 40-blacksmithing.md %}) and archery. I have also been getting more hands on with creating things for the hobby, including fletching (creating arrows), woodworking, and other random bits and pieces that I use for historical camping.

As part of this hobby, I regularly attend, and camp at, various Medieval Festivals and other events held throughout Australia. I also host and manage the [Medieval Archery Society]({{ site.data.links.main.mas }}) website.

I currently portray an English longbowman, during the time of the Hundred Years War. My primary longbow is a 48 pound self bow made from Osage Orange.
