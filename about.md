I'm a Linux Systems Administrator currently living in Sydney. In mid 2014 I made a massive change to my life and moved interstate, away from my friends and family in Adelaide, to Sydney in order to furthur my career. Since then I have stepped up and moved from Technical Support to System Administration.

I have over 6 years of IT experience in general, and have worked in the Hosting and Telecommunication industries. I run a personal <a href="/homelab">homelab</a> which I use to learn new things about technology and practise the art of automating almost everything.

I value freedom and privacy, and support the priciples of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). In my spare time I participate in <a href="/archery">Archery</a> with the <a target="_blank" href="https://medievalarchery.org.au/">Medieval Archery Society</a>.

My preferred method of contact is through [email](mailto:alex@alexgardner.id.au), my [GPG key](/alex-gardner-public-key.asc) is avaliable for encrypted communications. I also have a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandergardner?rel=author) page, but do not update it much.

Updates to this website and blog are irregular.
